- **Root**: Top node
- **Leaf**: Node with no children
- **Parent/Child**: Relationships
- **Height**: Longest path from node to leaf
- **Depth**: Distance from root to node

## 🌲 Types
- Binary Tree
- BST
- AVL Tree
- Complete Tree
- Full Tree
- N-ary Tree
- Trie

## 🔍 Properties
- Nodes at level l: 2^l
- Max nodes in binary tree of height h: 2^(h+1) - 1
- Leaves = Internal nodes + 1 (in full binary tree)
